##Forest Fire Prediction
This project aims to predict the occurrence of forest fires using machine learning techniques. 
The prediction model is developed based on various features such as weather conditions, geographical factors, and historical fire data. By analyzing these features, the model can forecast the likelihood of a forest fire happening in a particular area.

##Introduction
Forest fires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, wildlife, and human settlements. Predicting these fires in advance can help authorities take preventive measures to minimize damage and protect lives. 
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model capable of estimating the risk of forest fires based on various environmental factors.

##Data
The dataset used in this project contains historical information about forest fires, including meteorological data, geographical coordinates, and fire occurrence records.
The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and extract relevant information for model training.


##Methodology
The predictive model is developed using a combination of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques. Initially, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the data distribution and identify patterns. Feature engineering is then employed to create additional features that might enhance the model's predictive power. Various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest,decision tree,logistic regression are used to train machines and evaluated using appropriate metrics.
